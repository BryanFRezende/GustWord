## Truly Random and Memorizable Password Generator

OK, at least that's the hope. Here's my try at a password generator that's actually random. How you ask? By using the wind. And why is this generator special? Because you'll actually be able to memorize the password...at least as well as you can memorize any other phrase. How you ask, again? By using real words to generate a password and making a story that helps you remember it.

Why am I making this if there are already so many password generators out there? Because I didn't get a research internship this summer and I have to fill my time with something now don't I? No...it's not to make your life more convenient, though that might be a beneficial consequence.

I have just started this project last week (5/17ish/2021) so there is just a bit of work done but I will try to update regularly.
